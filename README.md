HR Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of HR data, focusing on key aspects such as employee performance, satisfaction, experience, and attrition. We utilize Python for data preprocessing, SQL for deriving insights, and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards. Our exploration covers various metrics, including:

Employee count
Average satisfaction ratings
Performance ratings
Salary trends over time
The analysis also delves into employee demographics, including age, gender, ethnicity, and frequency of business travel.

Objectives
The project aims to identify relationships between employee experience (e.g., years at the company) and performance ratings, as well as assess the impact of training opportunities on top performers. Additionally, we conduct attrition analysis by department and job role to pinpoint areas with high turnover, enabling HR managers to implement targeted retention strategies effectively.

Technologies Used
